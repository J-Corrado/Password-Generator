# Password-Generator

## A Secure Random Password Generator
---
The purpose of this project was to build a simple web application that randomly generates secure passwords as according to OWASP standards when requested.

The criteria will be that the User:

  1. Must have the option to choose between a minimum of 8 characters long and a maximum of 128 characters long
  2. Must have the option to contain at least one lower case letter
  3. Must have the option to contain at least one upper case letter
  4. Must have the option to contain at least one special character
  5. Must have the option to contain at least one numerical value

If the user does not properly enter the password criteria requirements, they will be alerted to the invalid input and prompted to enter input again.

    As the final and most important requirement, the password must be generated at random regardless of previously stated conditions.
